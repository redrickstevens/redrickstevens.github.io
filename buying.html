      <h2>Purchasing Artwork</h2>

<p>Thank you so much for your interest in my work. This page will give you some further information on how you can purchase available artwork.</p>

<p>Currently, all work is shipped directly from my studio. Shipping to anywhere in the UK, Europe and the US should all be possible. Anywhere outside of those areas is still likely, but contact me first so that we can discuss. I tend to ship pieces already stretched (which is how I work on them), but I am also able to ship them rolled up if you'd like a cheaper option. Please be aware that there will most likely be a customs or tax charge if you are outside of the UK.</p>

<p>The price of my work can range depending on the age and size of the piece, but usually the range is around £800 up to £1500. If you let me know the title of the piece you're interested in, I can give you an exact price.</p>

<p>The best way to contact me is via instagram DM. There is also my email: redrickstevens@protonmail.com</p>
